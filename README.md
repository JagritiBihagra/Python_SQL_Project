* **Top 5 Customers by Revenue**

  ```sql
  SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_spent
  FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
  JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

* **Monthly Sales Trend**

  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
  FROM orders
  JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
  GROUP BY month

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also generate a **ready-to-use `requirements.txt`** (with common Python + SQL libraries), so you can include it in your repo?
